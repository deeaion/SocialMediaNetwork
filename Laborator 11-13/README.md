## Social Network App - Final Project

### Weeks 11-13

**Disclaimer:** Please note that while the app has been completed for the course, there is ample room for improvement. I will outline areas for enhancement below, and further updates are planned.

**Tasks:**
- Implementation of a paginated repository with limits and offsets to enhance data retrieval efficiency.
- Integration of password encryption to bolster security measures.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Messaging System Optimization:**
    - Address the issue of slow message loading by incorporating threads and pagination.
    - Utilize existing message filters to improve loading speed.
    - Enhance the design and user experience of the messaging interface.

2. **Profile Images:**
    - Enhance consistency in profile picture (pfp) display by ensuring uniformity in image sizes and styles. For now there are some fun and cute images with animals that I have used for certain scenarios.
    - Consider implementing a feature to allow users to upload and display custom profile images.

These improvements aim to optimize app performance, enhance user experience, and refine overall functionality.
